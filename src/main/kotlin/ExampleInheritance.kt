//practice
//A class bird has a color and a flight speed.
//It has a fly method that prints out some flight information.
//A parakeet is a bird that has a different color and speed.
//Its fly method prints out the flight information, but also that of the average bird.
//Create a parakeet object and print out its flight information.

open class Bird{
    open var birdColor = "purple"
    open var flightSpeed = 10
    open fun fly(){
        println("A bird $birdColor can up to fly spped $flightSpeed")
    }

//Exercise
//A class Father has a first name and last name. It also has a function that prints out the personâ€™s name.
//A class Son inherits from Father and overrides the first name.It also overrides the message function,
//which now prints out both the name of the person, and the name of the father.
//Implement this structure in a program.

open class Father{
    open var firstName = "Alice"
    open var lastName = "bob"

    open fun printPersonName(){
        println("The name is $firstName and $lastName")
    }
}

class Son:Father(){
    override var firstName = "Saranya"
    override fun printPersonName() {
        super.printPersonName()
        println("A personame ${super.firstName} and ${super.lastName}")
